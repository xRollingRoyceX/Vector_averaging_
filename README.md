# Vector_averaging_
me learning how to structure programs in c++ still, keeping to the standard as much as possible and to my understanding. 

REF_NBR_VEC_ header file should be used if you need some numbers to divi-up to check its math and its ability to calculate numbers of various sizes and amounts.
      -otherwise dont use REF_NBR_VEC_. 



im loving c++, and id love some feedback :)
